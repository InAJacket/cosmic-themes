# cosmic-themes
A collection of themes for the COSMIC DE.

Mostly based on existing themes or colour palettes:
- Ophéline and its derivatives are taken from the colour schemes of the game *Pâquerette Down The Bunburrows*.

Ophéline themes come as two files, one with the original colour values from the game, and the other with values tweaked to look better on a DE. Importing both of these files will make your "Dark" theme option the tweaked values, and your "Light" theme option the original values.
